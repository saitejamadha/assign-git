Ques 1: What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Answer:
 a) gitignore file is a text document which contains a list of files that you want git to ignore when committing to the repository. ".gitignore" can have file names, folders or files patterns.
 b) It should include 

 # Compiled class files
 *.class

 # Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
 .mtj.tmp/  (which is Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME))

 # Log files
 *.log
 
 # Package Files
 *.jar
 *.war
 *.nar
 *.ear
 *.zip
 *.tar.gz
 *.rar  for a java project.

Apart from these, it should also include any Build Tool and IDE specific configuration files/folders

Ques 2: What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Answer: In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit
For example, assume we created a new branch from the master and kept working on it. As long as nobody else committed to master while we were working in this branch, could do a "fast-forward merge" which basically means that git simply moves the HEAD pointer for that branch to the latest commit without doing any hard work.
If someone else had made a commit before you merged your changes back to master, it would be a standard merge where git had to try and determine if there were any conflicts between the two sets of changes. 

Ques 3: Why should you have different branches?
Answer: In a collaborative environment, it is common for several developers to share and work on the same source code. 
Branching allows each developer to isolate their work from the original code base and safely experiment with new ideas, features, bug fixes in their contained area. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

Ques 4: In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Answer: We can have as many remotes as we want, as long as they have different names.
